# Achievements

This repository contains an HTML file (`index.html`) along with an associated CSS file (`style.css`) to display an image gallery showcasing various achievements. The HTML file includes a structure for the gallery and placeholders for images, while the CSS file provides styling to enhance the presentation.

## Contents

- `index.html`: This HTML file defines the structure of the image gallery. It contains placeholders for images along with corresponding headings for each achievement.
  
- `style.css`: This CSS file provides styling rules to enhance the appearance of the image gallery. It adjusts layout, typography, and other visual aspects to ensure a pleasant viewing experience.

## Usage

To view the image gallery, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The gallery will display the achievements along with their respective images and headings.

## Customization

You can customize the gallery by replacing the placeholder images (`AWS Cloud.jpg`, `AWS Machine Learning.jpg`, etc.) with your own images. Make sure to update the `alt` attribute of each `<img>` tag with appropriate descriptions for accessibility.

You can also modify the headings of each achievement by editing the text within the `<h3>` tags in the HTML file.

Feel free to tweak the CSS styles in `style.css` to match your desired aesthetic preferences.
